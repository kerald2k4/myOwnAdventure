<h1>MY TRIP TO THE MOON</h1>
<h1> Life on Earth was becoming boring and wanted to explore different places. I decided to buy a rocket and go to the Moon. On my trip to the Moon, I challenged a gorilla in space to a duel, I conquered a planet and named it Rapture, and I built a mansion out of moon rocks with Invader Zim. Which adventure would you like to know more about ? </h1>

	<p> When I arrived at the Moon, a gorilla had taken over the Moon and he was causing mayhem which made all the planets furious. He stayed up until the next day with his speaker on the highest volume everyday. He would drive his spaceship to other planets and throw bananas too. So I challenged the gorilla to a duel once and for all, the battle lasted for 2 days and I finally won when he slipped on a banana peel. At last, there was peace and quiet in Space.<p>

	<p> On one of my adventures in space, I conquered a planet south of the Milky Way. To my surpirse, pengiuns were settled on this planet. I had to fend them off so I put them all in my ship and took them to the Moon. I returned with a flag with my name on it and put it in the middle of the planet. I named it Rapture and it became my home and the pengiuns took over the Moon.

	<p> I forgot to tell you guys that I found Invader Zim on Mars. I needed help with my planet, Rapture, and I asked him if he can help me built a mansion. He only agreeed if I let him live in the mansion so I told him he can as long as he doesn't blow anything up. It took us years to finish this mansion but Invader Zim had an idea to finish faster and he went back to Mars to get his cloning device, we finished the next day and enjoyed a couple drinks to celebrate.
